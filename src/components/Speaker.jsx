          After working at Unacademy as a Product Director, I co-founded
          Airtribe to make professional upskilling a lot more accessible and
          outcome-focused. The idea was to champion learning with a
          community-led approach. At Airtirbe, I handle all things product and
          growth. I&#x27;m super excited to meet you and start your journey of
          learning together!
